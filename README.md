# HomeServer

## Idea

ESP32 home server, to connect several µCs to it and send data. The server is supposed to wait for the incomin data and display them. It also will have a SD-Card, so that it can show previos values, and graphs.

## State

At the moment the Server can read the sensors, and display them in the Browser.
